## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Installation & Running Locally

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the backend:**
    For the frontend to work correctly, the backend API must be running. Ensure the backend is running (e.g., via Docker Compose) so that the proxy can connect to it.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`. The development server uses the `proxy.conf.json` file to automatically redirect API requests from `/api/v1` to the backend at `http://localhost:8080`.
