## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to be run easily using Docker.

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/viniciusmcabral/sound-rate.git
    cd sound-rate
    ```

2.  **Create the Environment File (`.env`):**
    In the project's root directory, create a file named `.env`. This file will provide all the necessary secrets and configurations to the Docker containers. Use the `.env.example` file (located in the backend README) as a template.
    
    **Example `.env` content:**
    ```env
    # Variables for the Postgres container
    POSTGRES_DB=sound_rate_db
    POSTG-RES_USER=sound_rate_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password

    # Secret for JWT generation
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_jwt_key

    # API Key for SendGrid email delivery
    SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_sendgrid_api_key.xxxxxxxx
    ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    This single command will build the images for the frontend and backend, start all containers, and connect them.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    - **Frontend:** [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
    - **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8080/api/v1](http://localhost:8080/api/v1)
    - **API Documentation (Swagger):** [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html)
